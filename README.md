# Credit Card Spending Habits in India

This dataset provides insights into credit card transactions made in India, offering a comprehensive look at the spending habits of
Indians across the nation. It includes variables such as Gender, Card type, City, and Expense type.

## Getting Started

To get started with this dataset, select the columns you want to analyze. Once your columns are selected, 
use pivot tables to create a summary of the total amount spent by month or city or other parameters of analysis.

## Suggested Analysis

Some suggested analysis would include factors such as gender and seasonality/timing of spending. 
Combining multiple criteria such as ‘amount’ with ‘expense type’ or ‘date’ can generate more informative visuals and summaries. External information such as population size/density/income levels can also be compared with these findings.

## Potential Use Cases

This dataset can be used to analyze consumer trends and interests by looking at the type of purchases people make based on their gender and city.
It can also be used to detect potential credit card fraud or malicious activity by analyzing changes in spending habits or unusual purchases. 
Additionally, it can be used to predict spending patterns for promotional campaigns, such as during festivals or holidays, in order to better target customer segments according to city and gender-based spending habits.

# Credit Card Transaction Queries

1. Write a query to print top 5 cities with highest spends and their percentage contribution of total credit card spends.
2. Write a query to print highest spend month and amount spent in that month for each card type.
3. Write a query to print the transaction details (all columns from the table) for each card type when it reaches a cumulative of 1000000 total spends (We should have 4 rows in the output, one for each card type).
4. Write a query to find the city which had the lowest percentage spend for gold card type.
5. Write a query to print 3 columns: city, highest_expense_type, lowest_expense_type (example format: Delhi, bills, Fuel).
6. Write a query to find the percentage contribution of spends by females for each expense type.
7. Which card and expense type combination saw the highest month over month growth in Jan-2014?
8. During weekends, which city has the highest total spend to total number of transactions ratio?
9. Which city took the least number of days to reach its 500th transaction after the first transaction in that city?
10. Which city took least number of days to reach its 500th transaction after the first transaction in that city?
